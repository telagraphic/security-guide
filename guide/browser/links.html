  <h3>Private Browsing</h3>
  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      The best explanation of <a href="https://www.blaseur.com/papers/www18privatebrowsing.pdf">private browsing comes from this paper</a>
      "Unwanted information from the userâ€™s browsing history will not appear in the history bar, auto-filled forms, or search suggestions.
      Private modes thus help users hide browsing sessions from people sharing a device with them"
    </p>

    <h4>Private Browsing does not 100% prevent:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Geolocation tracking
      </li>
      <li>
        Malware protection
      </li>
      <li>
        Advertising elimination
      </li>
      <li>
        Tracking by websites you visit
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      Many people have a false understanding that private browsing will magically <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/no-private-browsing-mode-wont-hide-your-search-history-from-advertisers/">protect you from advertisers and spyware</a>.
      <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tracking-protection">Firefox does allow blocking while in private mode, but these are two different features</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google chrome will <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7440301">still track you when using incognito mode</a>.
