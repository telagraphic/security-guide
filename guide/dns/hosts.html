      <h3>Hosts File</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">Hosts File</a> maps domain names to IP addresses.
        Back in the early days of the Internet, there was no Domain Name System and people kept the IP Address and domain name in a file called hosts.
        It is simple text file that maps the name of the website to the IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, when making a web request your computer will check this file and if no entry exists it will query a DNS server, to find the IP Address for a certain website.
        Your ISP will assign you a DNS server which they control and can log and record your activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        A DNS server simply finds and translates the name into the IP Address so that your machine can route and connect your device to the website you are searching for.
        A hosts file can <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/hosts-files-explained/">speed up performance, block known ad/spyware/malicious websites before your browser even sends an HTTP request</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">curated and compiled list of hosts files</a> are useful for fending off these bad websites.
        Beware, some websites you go to might be blocked, so read through a file to see what is allowed or not.
