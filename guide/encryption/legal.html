          <p>
            Encryption is the process of converting a file, image or any kind of digital data into unreadable code
            that cannot be read without a cipher or password that can decrypt.
            If you have files with sensitive information like financial statements, passwords, account information,
            health data, or stuff you just want to keep private, encryption is a good idea.

            If someone physically steals your computer or device, they will not be able to see your information.
            There are pros and cons to encryption, considerations that you will need to spend time investigating.

            Piece of mind is nice and rather easy to set up.
