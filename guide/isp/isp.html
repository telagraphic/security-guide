            <p>
              Internet Service Providers connect you to the Internet,
              they are the companies you pay your bill to for renting their
              modem and router that sits in your house.
              Much like a phone, cable or utility company,
              your ISP has the physical infrastructure
              - cables, networking and routing equipment.
              They connect to other ISP's that serve content
              and websites that you view in your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might have noticed that many ISP's are phone and cable companies.
              Dial-up (phone wires), cable, DSL, satellite,
              fiber optics and much more are the physical
              mediums which data is transferred over.

            <h2>Tracking & Personal Data</h2>
            <p>
              Your ISP can see what you websites you visit,
              but not necessarily your passwords or information you send.
              The big concern about an ISP tracking you is the meta-data they sell about you.

              Depending on your ISP and their terms of service,
              they could save your data for up to a couple of years.
