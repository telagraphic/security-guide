      <h1>Internet Service Provider</h1>

      <p>
        Internet Service Providers connect you to the Internet, they are the companies you pay your bill to for renting their modem and router that sits in your house.
        Much like a phone, cable or utility company, your ISP has the physical infrastructure - cables, networking and routing equipment.
        They connect to other ISP's that serve content and websites that you view in your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might have noticed that many ISP's are phone and cable companies.
        Dial-up (phone wires), cable, DSL, satellite, fiber optics and much more are the physical mediums which data is transferred over.

    <h3>Tracking & Personal Data</h3>
    <div class="section-content">
      <p>
        Your ISP can see what you websites you visit, but not necessarily your passwords or information you send.
        The big concern about an ISP tracking you is the meta-data they sell about you.
        Depending on your ISP and their terms of service, they could save your data for up to a couple of years.
        Verizon was caught <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/two-ways-your-isp-is-spying-on-you-and-how-to-be-safe/caught">inserting tracking cookies secretly into your requests</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way to prevent your ISP from tracking you is using a <a href="#">VPN</a> (Virtual Private Network) or <a href="https://lifehacker.com/5923017/how-can-i-prevent-my-isp-from-tracking-my-every-move">TOR</a>.
