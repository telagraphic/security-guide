          A Virtual Private Network sits between your computer/device and the Internet,
          it encrypts and anonymizes your connection, making it impossible or very challenging
          for someone to trace you, view or modify your data. There are many VPN services,
          some free or very cheap, that promise to not log your internet searching.
